# hello-world

My first repository to create an understanding of how github works
I've been dabbling in code for over 30 years and have finally decided to make a career of it in order to foster my creative side.
My first language to learn was Extended Color Basic which was hardcoded into my first computer, a Tandy 1000. This was right before Microsoft burst onto the scene with its Windows operating system. The Tandy basically did nothing until some code was entered.
The Tandy came with a book that taught you how to code Extended Color Basic. My first program was "The Loop" program, which consisted of:
1: print "hello"
2: goto 1
As you can imagine it did not go well. But then I figured out the escape button and all was well again.
As I began to learn more I wanted to play some games, but no games were really available. After figuring out how to draw and animate shapes, I created my own version of Missile Command. The game would drop bombs on my cities and I would move my cursor to where I wanted my missiles to explode and hit the space bar to fire them. After I would fire the first missile the game would freeze and tell me I was out of memory.
That was the start of something special for me.
